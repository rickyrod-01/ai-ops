# Yes, I can provide an example of how to use the AWS CodeStar CLI to create an AI Ops project. 
# Here is an example of the steps you can follow:

# First, make sure you have the AWS CodeStar CLI installed and configured on your local machine. 
# You can do this by following the instructions in the AWS CodeStar documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codestar/latest/userguide/getting-started-cli.html

# Next, create a new AI Ops project using the create-project command. This command takes several parameters, 
# including the name of the project, the ID of the template to use, and the ID of the AWS CodeCommit
# repository to use for the project. Here is an example of the command:

aws codestar create-project --name my-ai-ops-project --template-id aiops-2020-10-14 --repository aiops-repo

# After the project is created, you can use the create-stack command to create a CloudFormation stack for the 
# project. This stack will contain all of the resources required for the project, including any AWS resources 
# that are needed. Here is an example of the command:

aws codestar create-stack --stack-name my-ai-ops-stack --project-id my-ai-ops-project --template-body file://aiops.yaml

# Once the stack is created, you can use the create-pipeline command to create a pipeline for the project. This 
# pipeline will be used to build, test, and deploy the project. Here is an example of the command:

aws codestar create-pipeline --pipeline-id my-ai-ops-pipeline --project-id my-ai-ops-project --stage-name build --template-body file://aiops-pipeline.yaml

# You can then use the start-pipeline-execution command to start the pipeline and build, test, and deploy the
# project. Here is an example of the command:

aws codestar start-pipeline-execution --pipeline-id my-ai-ops-pipeline
