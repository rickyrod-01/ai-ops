# Here is an example of how you can use the AWS CodeCommit command line interface (CLI) to perform various 
# operations on your CodeCommit repository.

# First, you'll need to install the AWS CLI and configure it with your AWS credentials. You can do this by
# following the instructions in the AWS CLI documentation:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html


# Once you have the AWS CLI installed and configured, you can start using it to interact with CodeCommit. Here are
# some examples of common operations you might perform:

# 1. Clone a repository:

aws codecommit clone-repository --repository-name my-repo --clone-url https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/my-repo

# 2. Create a new repository:

aws codecommit create-repository --repository-name my-repo

# 3. List all repositories:

aws codecommit list-repositories

# Add a file to the repository and commit it:

echo "This is a new file" > new-file.txt
git add new-file.txt
git commit -m "Added a new file"

# Push changes to the remote repository:

git push origin master
